# Working with images in Python
Hello!! <br>
Welcome to my first repo<br>
These are some projects from an Image Processing course. They are small, useful programs that helped me as a guide with a lot of fundamental information about image processing in **Python** and **PIL** library.

  <br>

## **Project Goals** <br>
  - Apply basic concepts of digital image processing.
  - Image manipulation using standard Python libaries. 
  - Work with different color modes and image formats. 
  - Visually analyze the results of the transformations performed.
  
## **Technologies Used**
  - Python 3.
  - PIL (Pillow): Used for loading, manipulating, and converting images.
  - Matplotlib: Used for visualizing images and results.
  - Spyder IDE: Development environment used for code implementation and testing.

## **Types of Images Used**
During the practical sessions, we worked with images in different color modes, including:
  - RGB (Red, Green, Blue).
  - RGBA (RGB with alpha channel).
  - CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black).
  - YCbCr (Luminance and Chrominance).
These formats allowed us to analyze how visual information is represented and processed in different color spaces. 

## **Repository Content** 
The repository includes scripts that perform tasks such as: 
  - Image loading and display.
  - Conversion between different color modes.
  - Pixel manipulation.
  - Color channel separation.
  - Visual analysis of results.
Each file corresponds to a separate exercise or practice within the course.
