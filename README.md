Hello!! <br>
Welcome to my first repo!<br>
These are some projects from an Image Processing course. They are small, useful programs that helped me as a guide with a lot of fundamental information about image processing in Python.

  <hr>

**Project Goals** <br>
  -Apply basic concepts of digital image processing. <br>
  -Image manipulation using standard Python libaries. <br>
  -Work with different color modes and image formats. <br>
  -Visually analyze the results of the transformations performed.<br>
  
**Technologies Used** <br>
  -Python 3 <br>
  -PIL (Pillow): Used for loading, manipulating, and converting images. <br>
  -Matplotlib: Used for visualizing images and results. <br>
  -Spyder IDE: Development environment used for code implementation and testing. <br>

**Types of Images Used** <br>
During the practical sessions, we worked with images in different color modes, including: <br>
  -RGB (Red, Green, Blue) <br>
  -RGBA (RGB with alpha channel) <br>
  -CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) <br>
  -YCbCr (Luminance and Chrominance) <br>
These formats allowed us to analyze how visual information is represented and processed in different color spaces. <br>

**Repository Content** <br>
The repository includes scripts that perform tasks such as: <br>
  -Image loading and display <br>
  -Conversion between different color modes <br>
  -Pixel manipulation <br>
  -Color channel separation <br>
  -Visual analysis of results <br>
Each file corresponds to a separate exercise or practice within the course. <br>
